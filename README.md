Understanding the Problem -  Fake_news_Classification

ðŸ”¹   The rise of misinformation and fake news has made it essential to develop automated detection systems.

ðŸ”¹   This project focuses on using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to identify fake news.

ðŸ”¹   Natural Language Processing (NLP) converts text into numerical representations for analysis.

ðŸ”¹   Machine learning models are trained on these representations to predict the  authenticity of news articles.

ðŸ”¹   An AI-powered fake news detector helps media organizations and companies identify misleading content efficiently.

ðŸ”¹   This case study involves analyzing thousands of news articles to determine their authenticity.
