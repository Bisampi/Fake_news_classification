        "# **📌 Introduction**\n",
        "\n",
        "In today’s digital world, misinformation and fake news are widely spread across various platforms, making it difficult for readers to distinguish between real and fake content. The rise of social media and online news sources has amplified the spread of misleading information, which can have serious social, political, and economic consequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "To combat this issue, **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) and **Machine\n",
        "Learning (ML) techniques** can be leveraged to develop automated fake news detection systems. These AI-driven models analyze text content, extract meaningful patterns, and classify news articles as either **real** (label = 1) or **fake** (label = 0).\n",
        "\n",
        "**🔍 Problem Statement**\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective of this project is to develop a Fake News Detection System using\n",
        "**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model will analyze textual data and classify whether a given news article is real or fake based on historical patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Aspects of the Problem:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Fake news is often created to mislead people and influence opinions.\n",
        "*   NLP techniques convert textual data into numerical representations\n",
        "*  Machine Learning models, particularly RNNs (LSTM/BiLSTM), are trained to detect misleading patterns in news articles.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   An AI-driven system can help automatically detect fake news, reducing human effort and misinformation spread.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The dataset consists of thousands of news texts labeled as real (1) or fake (0).\n",
        "\n",

He loves it more than he loves Vladimir Putin which, according to him, is a lot.While Trump doesn t publicly express regret   ever   he probably has had second thoughts about at least some of his tweets   like this one about leadership.Leadership: Whatever happens, you're responsible. If it doesn't happen, you're responsible.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2013After Trumpcare once again failed to happen because Republicans couldn t come up with a workable plan if it saved their lives (like Obamacare has for so many), Trump said he was just going to let the Affordable Care Act fail.  I m not going to own it,  he pronounced.He also used to criticize Republicans for trying to gut Medicaid and Social Security.The Republicans who want to cut SS & Medicaid are wrong. A robust economy will Make America Great Again! https://t.co/u25yI5T7E8  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 11, 2015These days, Trump is all about doing exactly those things.Trump probably also isn t too fond of the fact that he sent out this tweet criticizing President Obama for  allegedly failing to accomplish things and stuff. After all, he had  full control  for two years.  He can never take responsibility,  Trump said at the time.Obama's complaints about Republicans stopping his agenda are BS since he had full control for two years. He can never take responsibility.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2012Now, almost five years later, he is desperately avoiding taking responsibility for his own failures despite having complete control.Speaking of control, Trump criticized Obama s alleged weakness with regard to Russia of all places in 2014.Putin has shown the world what happens when America has weak leaders. Peace Through Strength!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 28, 2014Now, he s rubbing Vladimir Putin s back in public and engaging in long intimate meetings his own wife can t break up. But he s tough on Russia. Totally tough. I mean, it s not like he s ever publicly fantasized about Vladimir Putin being his bestie or anything Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow   if so, will he become my new best friend?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 19, 2013Oh.Then, of course, there s this one. Trump is going out of his way to destroy our relationships with various world leaders and is currently pushing us into a war with North Korea, an ally of both Russia and China:Be prepared, there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into World War III.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2013At one point, speaking of Obama s non-scandals often promoted by Fox News, Breitbart, and Trump s other trusted media sources, Trump posed the question:  Can we handle another  scandal in D.C.I wonder what the next scandal will be in D.C.? Can we handle yet another?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2013Now, his administration is plagued by numerous actual scandals (usually involving Russia) often reported by the  FAKE NEWS  (sources he doesn t like) media like, um, CNN Great move by CNN if they sign Jeff Zucker. He was responsible for me and The Apprentice on NBC became #1 show!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2012Boy, that one is probably embarrassing for him given his numerous attacks on the Fraud News Network or whatever he s calling CNN these days.One of those FAKE NEWS stories he complains about is that he spends a lot of time playing golf   something he used to complain about the President doing.We pay for Obama's travel so he can fundraise millions so Democrats can run on lies. Then we pay for his golf.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2014Now, we spend millions so he can go golfing at his own properties on a regular basis.Trump also used to complain that Obama wouldn t release his records to the public   specifically, his birth certificate and college records to prove he wasn t born in Kenya (a lie The Donald used to push).Obama thinks he can just laugh off the fact that he refuses to release his records to the American public. He can't.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012We can t even get The Donald to release his taxes, something every other presidential candidate (and indeed President) in recent history has done.Trump is crazy and incompetent   someone most of the world thinks should not be in charge of our nuclear arsenal. Embarrassingly, Trump agrees. Well, he agreed when the leader in question was not him.The global warming we should be worried about is the global warming caused by NUCLEAR WEAPONS in the hands of crazy or incompetent leaders!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2014But at least Mr. 45 is with the rest of us when it comes to the need for a leader who isn t laughed at by the entire world, someone who is  truly great  and knows how to win.We need a President who isn't a laughing stock to the entire World. We need a truly great leader, a genius at strategy and winning. Respect!  Donald J.

This is all part of Google s  color revolution business, and also part of the Smart Power Complex used to manufacture public consent for humanitarian interventions  globally.The leak also reveals how Qatari network Al Jazeera played an active role in this plot too. Al Jazeera has already been caught repeatedly manipulating international news throughout the Middle East.In a just world, Hillary would be held to account by the mainstream media for this revelation, but it seems that it s just being ignored by the mainstream gatekeepers  Rudy Takala Washington ExaminerGoogle in 2012 sought to help insurgents overthrow Syrian President Bashar Assad, according to State Department emails receiving fresh scrutiny this week.Messages between former secretary of state Hillary Clinton s team and one of the company s executives detailed the plan for Google to get involved in the region. Please keep close hold, but my team is planning to launch a tool   that will publicly track and map the defections in Syria and which parts of the government they are coming from,  Jared Cohen, the head of what was then the company s  Google Ideas  division, wrote in a July 2012 email to several top Clinton officials. Our logic behind this is that while many people are tracking the atrocities, nobody is visually representing and mapping the defections, which we believe are important in encouraging more to defect and giving confidence to the opposition,  Cohen said, adding that the plan was for Google to surreptitiously give the tool to Middle Eastern media.Hillary Emails: Google tried to boost Assad defections https://t.co/lyma4eJp9a More: https://t.co/ZUfh7WDAT5 pic.twitter.com/nvNG0lFJWt  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 19, 2016 Given how hard it is to get information into Syria right now, we are partnering with Al-Jazeera who will take primary ownership over the tool we have built, track the data, verify it, and broadcast it back into Syria,  he said. Please keep this very close hold and let me know if there is anything [else] you think we need to account for or think about before we launch. We believe this can have an important impact,  Cohen concluded The message was addressed to deputy secretary of state Bill Burns; Alec Ross, a senior Clinton advisor; and Clinton s deputy chief of staff, Jake Sullivan. Sullivan subsequently forwarded Cohen s proposal to Clinton, describing it as  a pretty cool idea. Cohen worked as a low-level staffer at the State Department until 2010, when he was hired to lead Google Ideas, but was tied to the use of social media to incite social uprisings even before he left the department. He once reportedly asked Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to hold off of conducting system maintenance that officials believed could have impeded a brief 2009 uprising in Iran Continue this story at Washington ExaminerREAD MORE SMART POWER NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Smart Power Files\",\n          \"The top contenders in both the Democratic and the Republican presidential nominating races have roughly equal support among members of their respective parties, according to a national Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday.

        "Before constructing neural network layers, it is essential to define the vocabulary size, which represents the total count of unique words in the text corpus. The vocabulary size plays a crucial role in preparing text data for embedding layers, particularly through one-hot encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "One-hot encoding is a method used to convert categorical data, such as words in a sentence, into binary vectors. In NLP, each word in the vocabulary is assigned a unique index, and one-hot encoding represents it as a binary vector where only the corresponding index is set to 1, while all others remain 0. The vocabulary size determines the length of these binary vectors, ensuring that words are consistently represented within a predefined range.\n",
        "\n",
        "Setting a fixed vocabulary size, such as 5000, helps maintain computational efficiency and manage memory usage, especially when dealing with large datasets. However, it is important to find a balance—limiting the vocabulary size too much may exclude significant words, while an excessively large vocabulary can increase processing overhead.\n",

        "In neural networks, particularly LSTM models, maintaining a consistent input shape is crucial for effective processing. However, when dealing with text data, sentences or documents often vary in length, requiring a technique called padding to standardize input sizes. Padding involves appending extra tokens or characters to text sequences so that all inputs reach a uniform length. Typically, this is achieved by setting a maximum sequence length, often determined by the longest sentence in the dataset—commonly set to 5000 in this case.\n",
        "\n",
        "Libraries like Keras and PyTorch offer the pad_sequence() function, which automates the padding process, ensuring that all sequences conform to the required length. For text data in LSTM models, 'pre-padding' is frequently used, where padding tokens (such as zeros) are added at the beginning of sentences. This approach ensures that all input sequences maintain a uniform structure, allowing the LSTM model to process them consistently and effectively extract patterns from the text."

        "Instead of using a traditional feedforward neural network like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), we're employing a specialized type of recurrent neural network called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).\n",
        "\n",
        "LSTM networks are designed to capture and learn dependencies over time or sequence information in data.\n",
        "\n",
        "They are particularly effective in handling sequence prediction tasks where maintaining long-range dependencies is crucial, such as language modeling, machine translation, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the key advantages of LSTM networks is their ability to address the vanishing gradient problem, which is common in traditional recurrent neural networks.\n",
        "This problem arises when gradients become extremely small during training, hindering the ability of the network to learn long-term dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "LSTM networks overcome this issue by incorporating specialized memory cells and gating mechanisms, allowing them to selectively retain or forget information over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "The architecture of an LSTM network includes three main components: input gates, forget gates, and output gates. These gates control the flow of information within the network, enabling it to process sequential data effectively.\n",
